## StyleGAN2-ADA for generation of synthetic skin lesions
![Teaser image](./docs/stylegan2ada-moles.gif)

The usage of healthcare data in the development of artificial intelligence (AI) models is associated with issues around personal integrity and regulations. Patient data can usually not be freely shared and thus, the utility of it in creating AI solutions is limited. The main goal of the project was to explore GANs to generate synthetic data of skin lesions and test the performance of DL models train on that type of data in comparison to trained only on real one.

## Requirements

* Linux and Windows are supported, but we recommend Linux for performance and compatibility reasons.
* 1&ndash;8 high-end NVIDIA GPUs with at least 12 GB of memory. We have done all testing and development using NVIDIA DGX-1 with 8 Tesla V100 GPUs.
* 64-bit Python 3.7 and PyTorch 1.7.1. See [https://pytorch.org/](https://pytorch.org/) for PyTorch install instructions.
* CUDA toolkit 11.0 or later.  Use at least version 11.1 if running on RTX 3090.  (Why is a separate CUDA toolkit installation required?  See comments in [#2](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/issues/2#issuecomment-779457121).)
* Python libraries: `pip install click requests tqdm pyspng ninja imageio-ffmpeg==0.4.3`.  We use the Anaconda3 2020.11 distribution which installs most of these by default.
* Docker users: use the [provided Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) to build an image with the required library dependencies.

The code relies heavily on custom PyTorch extensions that are compiled on the fly using NVCC. On Windows, the compilation requires Microsoft Visual Studio. We recommend installing [Visual Studio Community Edition](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) and adding it into `PATH` using `"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio\<VERSION>\Community\VC\Auxiliary\Build\vcvars64.bat"`.

## Getting started - test with provided by NVIDIA models

Pre-trained networks are stored as `*.pkl` files that can be referenced using local filenames or URLs:

```.bash
# Generate curated MetFaces images without truncation (Fig.10 left)
python generate.py --outdir=out --trunc=1 --seeds=85,265,297,849 \
    --network=https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/pretrained/metfaces.pkl

# Generate uncurated MetFaces images with truncation (Fig.12 upper left)
python generate.py --outdir=out --trunc=0.7 --seeds=600-605 \
    --network=https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/pretrained/metfaces.pkl

# Generate class conditional CIFAR-10 images (Fig.17 left, Car)
python generate.py --outdir=out --seeds=0-35 --class=1 \
    --network=https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/pretrained/cifar10.pkl

# Style mixing example
python style_mixing.py --outdir=out --rows=85,100,75,458,1500 --cols=55,821,1789,293 \
    --network=https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/pretrained/metfaces.pkl
```

Outputs from the above commands are placed under `out/*.png`, controlled by `--outdir`. Downloaded network pickles are cached under `$HOME/.cache/dnnlib`, which can be overridden by setting the `DNNLIB_CACHE_DIR` environment variable. The default PyTorch extension build directory is `$HOME/.cache/torch_extensions`, which can be overridden by setting `TORCH_EXTENSIONS_DIR`.

**Docker**: You can run the above curated image example using Docker as follows:

```.bash
docker build --tag sg2ada:latest .
./docker_run.sh python3 generate.py --outdir=out --trunc=1 --seeds=85,265,297,849 \
    --network=https://nvlabs-fi-cdn.nvidia.com/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/pretrained/metfaces.pkl
```

Note: See [`docker_run.sh`](./docker_run.sh) for more information.

## Preparing datasets

Datasets are stored as uncompressed ZIP archives containing uncompressed PNG files and a metadata file `dataset.json` for labels.

Custom datasets can be created from a folder containing images; see [`python dataset_tool.py --help`](./docs/dataset-tool-help.txt) for more information. Alternatively, the folder can also be used directly as a dataset, without running it through `dataset_tool.py` first, but doing so may lead to suboptimal performance.

**ISIC 2020**: Download the [ISIC 2020 dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nroman/melanoma-external-malignant-256) and create ZIP archive:

```.bash
python dataset_tool.py --source=/tmp/isic-dataset --dest=~/datasets/isic256x256.zip --width=256 --height=256
```

## Training new networks - NVIDIA resources

In its most basic form, training new networks boils down to:

```.bash
python train.py --outdir=~/training-runs --data=~/mydataset.zip --gpus=1 --dry-run
python train.py --outdir=~/training-runs --data=~/mydataset.zip --gpus=1
```

The first command is optional; it validates the arguments, prints out the training configuration, and exits. The second command kicks off the actual training.

In this example, the results are saved to a newly created directory `~/training-runs/<ID>-mydataset-auto1`, controlled by `--outdir`. The training exports network pickles (`network-snapshot-<INT>.pkl`) and example images (`fakes<INT>.png`) at regular intervals (controlled by `--snap`). For each pickle, it also evaluates FID (controlled by `--metrics`) and logs the resulting scores in `metric-fid50k_full.jsonl` (as well as TFEvents if TensorBoard is installed or loged to wandb if one has an account).

The training configuration can be further customized with additional command line options:

* `--aug=noaug` disables ADA.
* `--cond=1` enables class-conditional training (requires a dataset with labels).
* `--mirror=1` amplifies the dataset with x-flips. Often beneficial, even with ADA.
* `--resume=ffhq1024 --snap=10` performs transfer learning from FFHQ trained at 1024x1024.
* `--resume=~/training-runs/<NAME>/network-snapshot-<INT>.pkl` resumes a previous training run.
* `--gamma=10` overrides R1 gamma. We recommend trying a couple of different values for each new dataset.
* `--aug=ada --target=0.7` adjusts ADA target value (default: 0.6).
* `--augpipe=blit` enables pixel blitting but disables all other augmentations.
* `--augpipe=bgcfnc` enables all available augmentations (blit, geom, color, filter, noise, cutout).

Please refer to [`python train.py --help`](./docs/train-help.txt) for the full list.

## Expected training time - NVIDIA resources

The total training time depends heavily on resolution, number of GPUs, dataset, desired quality, and hyperparameters. The following table lists expected wallclock times to reach different points in the training, measured in thousands of real images shown to the discriminator ("kimg"):

| Resolution | GPUs | 1000 kimg | 25000 kimg | sec/kimg          | GPU mem | CPU mem
| :--------: | :--: | :-------: | :--------: | :---------------: | :-----: | :-----:
| 128x128    | 1    | 4h 05m    | 4d 06h     | 12.8&ndash;13.7   | 7.2 GB  | 3.9 GB
| 128x128    | 2    | 2h 06m    | 2d 04h     | 6.5&ndash;6.8     | 7.4 GB  | 7.9 GB
| 128x128    | 4    | 1h 20m    | 1d 09h     | 4.1&ndash;4.6     | 4.2 GB  | 16.3 GB
| 128x128    | 8    | 1h 13m    | 1d 06h     | 3.9&ndash;4.9     | 2.6 GB  | 31.9 GB
| 256x256    | 1    | 6h 36m    | 6d 21h     | 21.6&ndash;24.2   | 5.0 GB  | 4.5 GB
| 256x256    | 2    | 3h 27m    | 3d 14h     | 11.2&ndash;11.8   | 5.2 GB  | 9.0 GB
| 256x256    | 4    | 1h 45m    | 1d 20h     | 5.6&ndash;5.9     | 5.2 GB  | 17.8 GB
| 256x256    | 8    | 1h 24m    | 1d 11h     | 4.4&ndash;5.5     | 3.2 GB  | 34.7 GB
| 512x512    | 1    | 21h 03m   | 21d 22h    | 72.5&ndash;74.9   | 7.6 GB  | 5.0 GB
| 512x512    | 2    | 10h 59m   | 11d 10h    | 37.7&ndash;40.0   | 7.8 GB  | 9.8 GB
| 512x512    | 4    | 5h 29m    | 5d 17h     | 18.7&ndash;19.1   | 7.9 GB  | 17.7 GB
| 512x512    | 8    | 2h 48m    | 2d 22h     | 9.5&ndash;9.7     | 7.8 GB  | 38.2 GB
| 1024x1024  | 1    | 1d 20h    | 46d 03h    | 154.3&ndash;161.6 | 8.1 GB  | 5.3 GB
| 1024x1024  | 2    | 23h 09m   | 24d 02h    | 80.6&ndash;86.2   | 8.6 GB  | 11.9 GB
| 1024x1024  | 4    | 11h 36m   | 12d 02h    | 40.1&ndash;40.8   | 8.4 GB  | 21.9 GB
| 1024x1024  | 8    | 5h 54m    | 6d 03h     | 20.2&ndash;20.6   | 8.3 GB  | 44.7 GB

The above measurements were done using NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPUs with default settings (`--cfg=auto --aug=ada --metrics=fid50k_full`). "sec/kimg" shows the expected range of variation in raw training performance, as reported in `log.txt`. "GPU mem" and "CPU mem" show the highest observed memory consumption, excluding the peak at the beginning caused by `torch.backends.cudnn.benchmark`.

In typical cases, 25000 kimg or more is needed to reach convergence, but the results are already quite reasonable around 5000 kimg. 1000 kimg is often enough for transfer learning, which tends to converge significantly faster. The following figure shows example convergence curves for different datasets as a function of wallclock time, using the same settings as above:

![Training curves](./docs/stylegan2-ada-training-curves.png)

Note: `--cfg=auto` serves as a reasonable first guess for the hyperparameters but it does not necessarily lead to optimal results for a given dataset. We recommend trying out at least a few different values of `--gamma` for each new dataset.

## Quality metrics

By default, `train.py` automatically computes FID for each network pickle exported during training. We recommend inspecting `metric-fid50k_full.jsonl` (or TensorBoard) at regular intervals to monitor the training progress. When desired, the automatic computation can be disabled with `--metrics=none` to speed up the training slightly (3%&ndash;9%).

Additional quality metrics can also be computed after the training:

```.bash
# Previous training run: look up options automatically, save result to JSONL file.
python calc_metrics.py --metrics="fid50k_full,kid50k_full,pr50k3_full,ppl2_wend" \
    --mirror=1 --data=~/datasets/isic256x256.zip --network=~/network-snapshot-000000.pkl
```

## Projecting images to latent space

To find the matching latent vector for a given image file, run:

```.bash
python projector.py --outdir=out --target=~/mytargetimg.png \
    --class_label=1 --network=~/pretrained/conditionalGAN.pkl
```

The above command saves the projection target `out/target.png`, result `out/proj.png`, latent vector `out/projected_w.npz`, and progression video `out/proj.mp4`. You can render the resulting latent vector by specifying `--projected_w` for `generate.py` for specific melanoma class:

```.bash
python generate.py --outdir=out --projected_w=out/projected_w.npz \
    --class=1 --network=~/pretrained/conditionalGAN.pkl
```

## Classification with EfficientNet-B2

In our studies generated synthetic images were used in binary classification task between melanoma and non-melanoma cases. To run training with Efficientnet-B2 use following command:

```.bash
python melanoma_classifier.py --syn_data_path=~/generated/  \
    --real_data_path=~/melanoma-external-malignant-256/ \
    --synt_n_imgs="0,15"
```

In above example `--syn_data_path` argument indicates path for synthetic images,
`--real_data_path` - real images and `--synt_n_imgs` stands for n non-melanoma, k melanoma synthetic images (measured in kimg) to add to the real data. We reported our studis using wandb (use `--wandb_flag` argument to report accuracy and loss for your own experiments). `--only_reals` flag enable training only for real images, while `--only_syn` will allow to take all artificial images from directory with synthetic images.

To make a diagnosis using trained model use [`predict.py`](predict.py) script.


## Visualizing the latent space
[`embeddings_projector.py`](https://github.com/aidotse/stylegan2-ada-pytorch/blob/main/embeddings_projector.py) performs the two following tasks:

* Project embeddings of a CNN used as feature extractor. (`--use_cnn`)

* Project w-vectors.

This generates a `metadata.tsv`, `tensors.tsv` and (optionally using `--sprite` flag) a sprite of the images. These files can be uploaded in the [Tensorboard Projector](https://www.tensorflow.org/tensorboard/tensorboard_projector_plugin) , which graphically represent these embeddings.

## Measuring authenticity

We additionaly calculated cosine distances between the CNN embeddings from the tsv file.
For details see [`read_tsv.py`](./CNN_embeddings_projector/read_tsv.py).

```.bash
python ./CNN_embeddings_projector/read_tsv.py --metadata=metadata.tsv \
    --embeddings_path=tensors.tsv --save_path=distances.txt
```
